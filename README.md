# Green-Guardian - Intelligent Waste Classification

Green Guardian is an ingenious waste classification application. By employing sophisticated clustering algorithms, this solution adeptly categorizes scanned waste items, distinguishing between wet and dry waste. This project aims to promote environmentally responsible waste disposal practices through an efficient and user-friendly interface.

### Technologies Used
- *Clustering Algorithms*: Leveraged advanced clustering algorithms to precisely categorize waste items based on their characteristics.
- *Python and Flask*: Used for backend development, ensuring a robust and scalable application.
- *HTML, JavaScript, and CSS*: Employed for front-end development, creating a visually appealing user interface.
- *OpenCV*: Utilized for opening the camera to detect and classify the type of waste.
